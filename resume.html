            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Mohammed Misbah, a passionate and dedicated interface designer and developer based in India. With a degree in Computer Applications, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enables me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces.
                Throughout my journey, I have gained practical experience as a Customer Executive, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and the ability to communicate effectively with clients. This role allowed me to appreciate the importance of understanding user needs and delivering solutions that enhance user experience.
                I am particularly interested in front-end development, where I can blend creativity with technical expertise to build dynamic and engaging websites. My projects reflect my commitment to quality and attention to detail, and I take pride in my ability to adapt to new challenges and work collaboratively within a team.
                I am currently seeking an entry-level opportunity where I can apply my skills in a dynamic organization that values innovation and growth. I am eager to contribute to exciting projects, learn from experienced professionals, and continue to expand my knowledge in the field of web development.
                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and trends in design, which fuels my creativity and keeps my work fresh and relevant. I believe that the intersection of technology and design is where the most impactful user experiences are created.</p>
